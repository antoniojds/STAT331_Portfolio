## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

# Cars Dataset

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

*This dataset contains information about [Speed and Stopping Distances of Cars]{.underline}. The data was collected in [the 1920s]{.underline}.*

*It has [6]{.underline} rows and [2]{.underline} variables.*

# Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot(pressure, xlab = "Temperature (deg C)",
     ylab = "Pressure (mm of Hg)",
     main = "pressure data: Vapor Pressure of Mercury")
fig.align = "center"
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Histogram for cars' stopping distance

```{r}
dist <- cars$dist
speed = cars$speed

hist(dist, xlab = "Stopping distance (ft)")

```

# Plot for cars' speed vs stopping distance

```{r}
plot(x = speed, 
     y = dist,
     xlab ="speed (mph)",
     ylab = "stopping distance(ft)")
```
